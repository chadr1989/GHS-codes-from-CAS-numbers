# GHS-codes-from-CAS-numbers
This is a project that scrapes PubChem data for GHS hazard codes given CAS numbers
Given a spreadsheet file that contains a column named 'CAS' filled with valid CAS codes, the script will add columns for 'PubChem ID' and 'GHS Codes'.
The PubChem ID is necessary to search NCBI data in the form of cascading text htmls with no formatting.
Just follow the notes, even users with little to no Python experience should be able to run the script and return an edited spreadsheet file with the forementioned data added.
